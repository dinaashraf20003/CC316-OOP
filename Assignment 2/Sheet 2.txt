Q7) Identify the problems in the following code:
Ans: ln5) radius = radius => this.radius= radius
     ln20) constructor should be public
     ln21) Circle(radius) => super(radius)
     ln22) length = length => this.length = length
     ln23) return getArea()*length => return super.getArea()*length
